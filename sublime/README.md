# Sublime Text
These are my setting for the [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) code editor.

To setup, first install [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/). Then, simply run the `link.jl` julia script:
```sh
julia link.jl
```
If you're on Windows, the script assumes Sublime is installed via [scoop](https://scoop.sh/).

Afterwards, start Sublime. It will look weird and throw errors about not finding themes and stuff, simply wait until Package Control installs all required Packages and it should work.

To complete the setup, install my [Vinimum](https://github.com/Treeniks/Vinimum) Package.

Additionally, I like installing the [Aura Theme](https://github.com/daltonmenezes/aura-theme), add a Github access token for the MarkdownPreview Package and add a Monokai Pro license.
